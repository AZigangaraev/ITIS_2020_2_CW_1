By the time of the Clone Wars, Mundi became a Jedi General of the Grand Army of the Republic. Like his Jedi colleagues, he led the Republic clone troopers against the Separatist Alliance forces in several battles across the galaxy, including the first and second campaign on Geonosis and the Outer Rim Sieges. In 19 BBY, the third and final year of the war, Mundi oversaw the Republic invasion of Mygeeto with the 21st Nova Corps under his command. During the campaign, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine instructed the Grand Army soldiers to execute their Jedi leaders in accordance with Order 66, an act which resulted in the death of Mundi along with the majority of the Jedi Order."}
